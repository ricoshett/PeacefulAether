PeacefulAether is a mod that makes the aether (the shimmer biome) truly peaceful

When the player inside the biome:
* No mobs can spawn
* Player can't take damage
* Player can't damage anyone (including target dummies)
* Player's life regeneration is disabled (can be turned off in the mod's config)
