Peaceful Aether is a mod that makes the aether (the shimmer biome) truly peaceful

When the player inside the biome:
[list]
    [*] No mobs can spawn
    [*] Player can't take damage
    [*] Player can't damage anyone (including target dummies)
    [*] Player's life regeneration is disabled (can be turned off in the mod's config)
[/list]
