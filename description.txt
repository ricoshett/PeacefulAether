Peaceful Aether is a mod that makes the aether (the shimmer biome) truly peaceful

When the player inside the biome (all the properties are toggleable in the config):
[list]
    [*] No enemies can spawn (true by default)
    [*] Player can't take any damage (false by default)
    [*] Player can't damage anyone including target dummies (false by default)
    [*] Player's life regeneration is disabled (false by default)
[/list]
